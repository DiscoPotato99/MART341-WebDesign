                <h4>Kirby</h4>
                 <p>Originally a placeholder, created by Masahiro Sakurai, at the age of 19, for the game's early development, 
                    he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from action platformers to puzzle, racing, and even pinball,
                     and has been featured as a playable fighter in all Super Smash Bros. games. He has also starred in his own anime
                      and manga series. Since 1999, he has been voiced by Makiko Ohmoto.

                    Kirby is well known for his ability to inhale objects and creatures to gain their powers,
                     as well as his ability to float by expanding his body. He uses these abilities to rescue various 
                     lands, including his homeworld of Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as Dark 
                     Matter or Nightmare. 
                     
                     On these adventures, he often crosses paths with his rivals, King Dedede and
                      Meta Knight, though Meta Knight can be seen as a hero, depending on the game. Kirby has been described
                       as one of the most legendary video game characters of all time by PC World.[3] In virtually all his 
                       appearances, Kirby is depicted as cheerful, innocent and food-loving but becomes fearless, bold and 
                       clever in the face of danger.</p>

                <h4>Pokemon</h4>
                <p>Pokémon[a] is a series of video games developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo 
                    and The Pokémon Company under the Pokémon media franchise. Created by Satoshi Tajiri with 
                    assistance from Ken Sugimori, the first games, Pocket Monsters Red and Green, released in
                     1996 in Japan for the Game Boy, and the main series of role-playing video games (RPGs), 
                     referred as the "core series" by their developers,[1][2][3] have continued on each generation
                      of Nintendo's handhelds. The most recently released core series games, Pokémon Sword and Shield,
                       were released worldwide on the Nintendo Switch on November 15, 2019.[4] The upcoming core series
                        games, Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Shining Pearl will be released in late 2021, and Pokémon 
                        Legends: Arceus in early 2022, both for the Nintendo Switch. They are remakes and a premake of
                         the 2006 Nintendo DS games Pokémon Diamond and Pearl, respectively.

                    The core games are released in generations, each with different Pokémon, storylines, and characters.
                     Remakes of the games are usually released around a decade after the original versions for the latest
                      console at the time. While the main series consists of RPGs developed by Game Freak, many spin-off 
                      games based on the series have been developed by various companies, encompassing other genres such 
                      as action role-playing, puzzle, fighting, and digital pet games.
                    
                    Pokémon is the world's largest media franchise,[5][6][7] with successful anime series, movies, and
                     merchandise, with spin-off game Pokémon Go having crossed 1 billion mobile game downloads worldwide.
                     [8] By November 24, 2017, more than 300 million Pokémon games had been sold worldwide on handheld and
                     home consoles, across 76 titles, including spin-offs.[9] As of March 2020, the series has sold over 368
                      million units worldwide.[10] This makes Pokémon the third best-selling video game franchise, behind Nintendo's
                       own Mario franchise and Tetris.</p>
