* Every single thing I learned in this class was completely new to me.
* I have taken many art classes and have loved designing things, although I diddn't go all out with most of the projects I now know how to (or at least have examples I can refer back to) if I ever want to make another website from scratch
* This whole class was super fun. i was challenged a lot, but still loved working with my roomate or co-workers to help get things done.
