* i've done all kinds of serveys that have form elments, they can serve as imput, evaluations, or creating an account.
* A text imput is a simple artea that asks for text such as "how old are you?" and then a text imput box would appear and you type your answer. A selection imput is what allows us to take multiple choice tests online for classes. It's an imput that has multiple selections. Lastly, a button imput example is a submit button, or even an image that you turn into a button that can send people somewhere or it could also be a submit button.
* My work cycle was a little back and forth loooking at your example code as well as looking at the example on the class website for different elements i wanted. I couldn't find an email for GameStop so I just typed a fake email just for practice.
