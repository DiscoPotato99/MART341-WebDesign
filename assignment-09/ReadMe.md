* Everything I have learned so far has been new to me. This has been my first ever time useing any sort of codeing. It has been pretty fun- but then again learning new things always is :)
* I have no idea what to expect in the new sections, but whatever it is, i'm ready for it!
* My most challenging thing has always been how i use my time. I never know how much is needed until i've told 5 people i'd do something with or for them just to let them down because i could only do so much. If i had all the time in the world I could do 1000 things, but unfortunetly I can't do everything... So i've really been hunkering down with getting work done, as much as I'd like to spend time with friends and family, there are things that are required in life and getting homework done is one of those.
