* Boarders are the edges around your content, padding is the space between the boarder and the content, and margins are the space between the outside of the boarder and the edge of the page.
* The main thing that i was confused about most was of what to put on the website, i saw in the example that you just used the same as assignment 11, so I also just put my favorite book down. I'm excited to maybe add stuff to the book 2 and book 3 drop down tabs we made. But other than that anything I might've been confused on I just double checked the example and made sure I had everything.
