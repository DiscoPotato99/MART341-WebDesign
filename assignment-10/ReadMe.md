* Universal selectors select every element that is on the page. Element selectors select all elements of the same type, such as all the h1's or all the h2's. Class selectors select all of the elements marked with class=. Lastly the ID selectors are for selecting a single element based off of its ID.
* My Colors were: Paris Hilton Pink, Nickelodeon Splat, Yes We Cyan, and LimeWire. I had found a website that had a breakdown of popular colors throughout the decades and these 4 were of the 6 that it had, i definently remember nickelodeon and paris hilton pink, and the other two just seem to fit, but i can't remember what from.
* this week I overcame my fear of looking for colors to put on my website, i didn't know that after i put in a basic color that if i hover over it that a color wheel appears and i can adjust it at will.
