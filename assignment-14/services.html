                 <p>As one of Nintendo's most popular and familiar major mascots, Kirby's round appearance and ability to copy 
                 his foes' powers has made him a well-known figure in video games, consistently ranked as one of the most iconic
                  video game characters. He first appeared in 1992 in Kirby's Dream Land for the Game Boy.</p>

                <h4>Early Life and Family</h4>
                <p>Originally a placeholder, created by Masahiro Sakurai, at the age of 19, for the game's early development, 
                    he has since then starred in over 20 games, ranging from action platformers to puzzle, racing, and even pinball,
                     and has been featured as a playable fighter in all Super Smash Bros. games. He has also starred in his own anime
                      and manga series. Since 1999, he has been voiced by Makiko Ohmoto.

                    Kirby is well known for his ability to inhale objects and creatures to gain their powers,
                     as well as his ability to float by expanding his body. He uses these abilities to rescue various 
                     lands, including his homeworld of Planet Popstar, from evil forces and antagonists, such as Dark 
                     Matter or Nightmare. 
                     
                     On these adventures, he often crosses paths with his rivals, King Dedede and
                      Meta Knight, though Meta Knight can be seen as a hero, depending on the game. Kirby has been described
                       as one of the most legendary video game characters of all time by PC World.[3] In virtually all his 
                       appearances, Kirby is depicted as cheerful, innocent and food-loving but becomes fearless, bold and 
                       clever in the face of danger.</p>
